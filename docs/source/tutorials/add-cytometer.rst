Tutorial - Adding a Cytometer
=============================

.. note:: Adding a cytometer requires either the project-level permission "Add Project Data" or the site-level permission "Add Site Data". See :doc:`../permissions`. Also, the site to which a cytometer belongs must be added to ReFlow prior to adding the cytometer.

#.  Login to the ReFlow server and navigate to the desired project by clicking on the project link.

#.  From the project detail page, click the **Add Cytometer** link.

    .. note:: Cytometers can also be added from the **Cytometer** list page by clicking on the **Add Cytometer** button located near the upper right of that page (beside the main heading).

#. A new modal window will appear displaying the form fields.

#.  On the cytometer form, fill out the relevant fields. Note, all fields are required and a site cannot have duplicate cytometers with the same cytometer name. Once the form is completed, click the **Save** button.

    .. note:: If there were validation errors with the submitted form, the form will be re-displayed along with the validation errors.

#.  Once the new cytometer is created, the modal window will close.
