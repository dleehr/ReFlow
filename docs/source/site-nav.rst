Home Page

The home page is a dashboard view of all the projects to which you belong as well as the user permissions you have for each project. You will not see any projects to which you do not have view permissions.

In the upper right corner of the page you will find your username and a 'Logout' link to log out of the system. Note, you will be automatically logged off after 15 minutes of inactivity.
